For my final project, I will be making a slide puzzle.
It will be a 4x4 or a 5x5 grid of tiles with numbers on them, randomly numbered and the user will 
have to maneuver the tiles to be in numerical sequence.
I might also include different modes of the games which include different grid sizes.
I got this idea from the show *Survivor* which includes many challenges, some of which are slide puzzles.

The background knowledge I have is from the show *Survivor* mentioned above. 
They do a variety of different slide puzzles which include slide puzzles of images, numbers that reveal number codes,
and big puzzles where they have to solve the puzzle to navigate a block or key out of the puzzle. 
One contestant on season 37 named Christian Hubicki competed in the first challenge of the 
season which included a slide puzzle.
He solved it in less than 30 seconds and it was later revealed that he worked on slide puzzle algorithms in college. 
Seeing a real world example of something I am learning in class will help keep me motivated.

For week 1, I want to create different classes for the tiles and start with just a 3x3 grid. 
I want to create a basic layout of the puzzle, get images and arrange them on the screen. 
I then want to figure out the controls the user will use, whether it be the mouse or the arrow keys or both. 
This might happen in both week 1 or week 2 depending on how long it takes for the previous tasks. 
In week 2, I want to have a working slide puzzle but with no end to the game.
I basically just want to make the game work and have the user be able to move the pieces around.
In week 3, I want to figure out the code for determining if the player wins. 
I will most likely assign a value or key to each tile and keep track of them in an array.
Using this array, I can then go through and see if after each turn, if the player won.

If I were to finish early, I would try to make different levels with different size boards. 
Doing this might require a starting screen where the user would pick what level they want to play. 
I could also use a picture instead of numbers if I have time, using the same logic and the user would maneuver the 
tiles to unscramble the picture.
